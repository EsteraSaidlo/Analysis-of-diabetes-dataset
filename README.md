# Analysis-of-diabetes-dataset

The project was made in order to learn how to use such methods in Python:

- detecting and filling in missing observations,
- data visualization,
- classification,
- clustering,
- multidimensional scaling. 

The analysis was based on the data set from the kaggle platform: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.
